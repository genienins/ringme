# Google Analytics
Though we don't store any personal information. apps may contain APIs from third parties. Specifically, our mobile games which use Google Analytics to help analyse how users behave in the game. We mainly look out for how long users have spent in the game and how many levels were played. This information is then used to evaluate use of our game and to improve the usability. All information collected via the Google Analytics API is anonymous.

# Advertisements
We display advertisements in our free apps and games to fund the development process for current and future Services. The advertisements are provided by third party companies and they may use and collect anonymous data about the User's interests to be able to select more relevant advertisements. This information may also include location data and unique device identifier. No information is collected to allow third parties identifying you as a person.
We use an external tool for the collection of analytic information. The tool uses similar information as used with advertisements.
Admob policy: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
We display internal advertisements which advertise other Kenny Play games which we feel players will be interested in; in order to provide the best scope of advertisements we use data listing all installed applications on your device allowing us to filter out games already installed. No user specific or app specific information is stored or recorded.
We cache images used for internal advertisements by storing them in the application root directory allowing us to re-display advertisements without needing to download them again keeping data usage to a minimum.
